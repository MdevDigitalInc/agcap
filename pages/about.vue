            |A General Partnership (GP) consisting of five managing principals. These principals are Jay Bradshaw, John DePutter, John Lansink, Michael Perovich and Greg Andrukow.

          p
            |We are forming a group of investors who can offer advice and expertise to the managing principals and may on occasion, offer services for the companies we decide to invest in.
          p
            |Although the managing principals will lead the research into prospective investments and make final decisions as to which companies to invest in, these leaders will consult with and at times ask for input from the investors.
          p
            |The approach of Ag Capital Canada is largely about choosing the right people to work with: the mix of people acting as principals, and those in the investment group, must be people with integrity and experience.
          p
            |In terms of the owner-operators who apply for our capital and assistance, we are looking for smart, honest, hard-working business owners with bright prospects.
