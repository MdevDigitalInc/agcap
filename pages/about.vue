            |We are forming a group of investors who can offer advice and expertise to the managing principals and may on occasion, offer services for the companies we decide to invest in.

            |The approach of Ag Capital Canada is largely about choosing the right people to work with: the mix of people acting as principals, and those in the investment group, must be people with integrity and experience.
          p
            |In terms of the owner-operators who apply for our capital and assistance, we are looking for smart, honest, hard-working business owners with bright prospects.
